    "The update for MC will be $w_{t+1} = w_t + \\alpha[G_t - \\hat{q}(S_t,A_t,w_t)]\\nabla \\hat{q}(S_t,A_t,w_t)$. It is not reasonable to give pseudocode for MC methods because they does not really fit for one-step update such as TD methods and Sarsa. Because, in order to have $G_t$ to update $w$, we would need to wait to the end of the epsiode. I would say it perform worse because the update for $w$ will be much slower because we need to wait till the end of the episode to collect $G_t$. Another disadvantage is that $G_t$ will have high variances even it is unbiased, which might make the problem even worse. \n",
